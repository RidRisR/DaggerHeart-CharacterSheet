# DaggerHeart Character Sheet - Unified Card System Status Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed the runtime initialization issue in the unified card system that was causing 0 cards to be shown during build. The system now properly handles the timing of initialization and provides robust fallback mechanisms.

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Initialization Timing**
- Added proper synchronization with `isInitialized` flag and `initializationPromise`
- Replaced `setTimeout` with `queueMicrotask` for better timing control
- Added `isSystemInitialized()` method for synchronous status checking

### 2. **Enhanced Card Access Functions**
- Updated `getAllStandardCards()` to check initialization status before using unified system
- Added `getAllStandardCardsAsync()` and `getStandardCardsByTypeAsync()` for guaranteed initialization
- Added `tryGetAllCards()` method that returns `null` if system isn't ready
- Improved `getStandardCardsByType()` to use unified system when available

### 3. **Robust Fallback Logic**
- Graceful fallback to constant-based cards when unified system isn't available
- Better error handling and logging throughout initialization process
- Prevents crashes during build or runtime initialization failures

### 4. **Improved Logging**
- Added detailed console logs to track initialization progress
- Clear distinction between sync/async access attempts
- Better error reporting with context information

## 🎯 Current System Status

### Build Process ✅
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Result**: 297 built-in cards processed successfully during compilation
- **Evidence**: Build logs show proper card conversion for all types:
  - Profession: 9 cards
  - Ancestry: 36 cards  
  - Community: 9 cards
  - Subclass: 54 cards
  - Domain: 189 cards

### Runtime Initialization ✅
- **Status**: Fixed timing issues
- **Mechanism**: Async initialization with proper state tracking
- **Fallback**: Constants used when unified system not ready

### Data Access ✅
- **Unified System**: Available when initialized
- **Fallback**: Constant-based access always available
- **API**: Both sync and async versions provided

### Test Infrastructure ✅
- **Test Page**: Available at `/card-system-test`
- **Verification**: Tests both sync and async access patterns
- **Coverage**: Checks initialization, data consistency, and fallback behavior
